### Canadian-Australian Partnership for Open Scholarship

The Canadian-Australian Partnership for Open Scholarship (CAPOS) is a collaboration between Canadian and Australian researchers, policy makers, libraries, computing organizations, research groups, and postsecondary institutions to advance the understanding of, and resolve crucial issues in, the production, distribution, and engagement of open, digital scholarship. CAPOS comprises the INKE Partnership and Australian-based partners. 

This partnership capitalizes on both countries’ positive track records of participating in, engaging, and influencing the international consideration of open, digital scholarship issues. CAPOS will work toward implementing elements of open scholarship policy and practice from the international sphere in national, regional, and local contexts—with a complementarity of governmental and academic institutional structures, legal frameworks, and a cultural predisposition toward collaboration.
