### Sydney Coding Club

The coding club was motivated by [ozunconf 2018](http://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/). The plan is to adopt a similar format to ozunconf and let the participants drive the agenda. You come to the designated place and work as much or as little on coding project you want. The idea is to be surrounded by people who wants to code! People are free to sit down and work on their own or work with others on a project. The project can be submitted as an [issue](https://github.com/emitanaka/sydneycodingclub/issues) on this repository. Occasionally we will have 5 minutes showcase of projects people have worked on.

The meetings are held at the University of Sydney, and organised by [Dr Emi Tanaka](https://emitanaka.github.io/).
