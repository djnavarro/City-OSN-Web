### DH Downunder

DH Downunder is a Digital Humanities / Digital Research Methods Summer Institute in the tradition of [DHSI ](http://www.dhsi.org/)and similar international summer institutes. We provide training in cutting edge Digital Research methods and approaches. People with all kinds of backgrounds are welcome, including students, academic staff, PhD and postdoctoral researchers, librarians and professional staff. The classes have a humanities/social sciences orientation, but we are also very happy to have participants from other disciplinary backgrounds.

It usually happens in early December, after universities have finished their second semester classes, and before people start heading away for the Christmas break. So far it has always been held in Sydney, but we are open to considering other hosting locations.
