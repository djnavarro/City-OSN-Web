### ResBaz: Research Bazaar

The Research Bazaar is a free, 3-day intensive festival and conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. Throughout 2018 ResBaz events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.
