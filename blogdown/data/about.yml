title   : What is the Open Research Network
description: >
  The Sydney Open Research Network is a collection of researchers and research-associated workers in Sydney, Australia. It aims to facilitate the growth of open practices by bringing together independently motivated and like-minded people, and providing a platform for the sharing of resources. The network is inspired by the <a href="https://openscience-utrecht.com/">Open Science Community Utrecht</a>,
  and the site is adapted from the <a href="https://morn.netlify.com">Melbourne Open Research Network</a> site. The site is built using <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown<a>, and uses the <a href="https://github.com/themefisher/timer-html">Timer Themefisher</a> theme.
