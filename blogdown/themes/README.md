# Warning!

As a general rule, you shouldn't edit anything in the `themes` folder - it will break when you update the theme later. If you want to adapt layouts, it's better to place your own version in the `layouts` folder as Hugo will give preference to your version over any file in `themes/{theme-name}/layouts`
