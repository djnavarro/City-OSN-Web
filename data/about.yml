title   : What is the Open Research Network
description: >
  The Sydney Open Research Network is a collection of researchers and research-associated workers in Sydney, Australia. It aims to facilitate the growth of open practices by bringing together independently motivated and like-minded people, and providing a platform for the sharing of resources. It is inspired by the <a href="https://openscience-utrecht.com/">Open Science Community Utrecht</a>.
