      <description>Sydney Coding Club The coding club was motivated by ozunconf 2018. The plan is to adopt a similar format to ozunconf and let the participants drive the agenda. You come to the designated place and work as much or as little on coding project you want. The idea is to be surrounded by people who wants to code! People are free to sit down and work on their own or work with others on a project.</description>

      <description>UNSW Computational Cognitive Science Sydney has a lot of beaches. They are very nice. Sometimes science people like to do to the beach too. Even open science people. This is a perfectly normal thing that regular people do.
Even in Sydney.</description>
