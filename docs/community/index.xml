      <description>Canadian-Australian Partnership for Open Scholarship The Canadian-Australian Partnership for Open Scholarship (CAPOS) is a collaboration between Canadian and Australian researchers, policy makers, libraries, computing organizations, research groups, and postsecondary institutions to advance the understanding of, and resolve crucial issues in, the production, distribution, and engagement of open, digital scholarship. CAPOS comprises the INKE Partnership and Australian-based partners.
This partnership capitalizes on both countriesâ€™ positive track records of participating in, engaging, and influencing the international consideration of open, digital scholarship issues.</description>

      <description>Sydney Coding Club The coding club was motivated by ozunconf 2018. The plan is to adopt a similar format to ozunconf and let the participants drive the agenda. You come to the designated place and work as much or as little on coding project you want. The idea is to be surrounded by people who wants to code! People are free to sit down and work on their own or work with others on a project.</description>
