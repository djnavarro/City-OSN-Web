      <description>What are the goals of the Open Research Network? As per the about section, the open research network exists to support the adoption of open research practices. What differs from other approaches is that this is deliberately and explicitly about putting people in contact in the real world, to reduce the barriers to entry, and minimise the risk of alienation that arises from context collapse on social media.
To that end, it aims to support the proliferation of institutional open science communities, like the successful model of the Open Science Community Utrecht, to provide a welcoming, non-judgemental learning environment at a local level.</description>

      <description>The Sydney Open Research Network (SOR) seeks to promote open practices, and as part of this vision is committed to the provision of a safe, inclusive, welcoming and harassment-free atmosphere to all.
All parties to activities associated with the Network are required to be compliant with the code of conduct.
If you observe something that you do not feel is consistent with these principles, please report them to the steering committee.</description>

      <description>Sydney Coding Club The coding club was motivated by ozunconf 2018. The plan is to adopt a similar format to ozunconf and let the participants drive the agenda. You come to the designated place and work as much or as little on coding project you want. The idea is to be surrounded by people who wants to code! People are free to sit down and work on their own or work with others on a project.</description>

In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. Throughout 2018 ResBaz events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.</description>

      <description>UNSW Computational Cognitive Science Sydney has a lot of beaches. They are very nice. Sometimes science people like to do to the beach too. Even open science people. This is a perfectly normal thing that regular people do.
Even in Sydney.</description>
